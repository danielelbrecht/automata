# About
I discovered the idea of growing neural cellular automata
here : https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/

Cellular automata theory is a rich field which has been around for some 
time.  The basic idea is that given cells with some initial state and a 
simple update rule

Neural cellular automata (abbreviated NCA) extends this 


# Code

# Usage
To train an new NCA model, run the following command:
```
python main.py -t --img path-to-img --model path-to-model
```

To run a trained model:
```
python main.py -e --model path-to-model
```
